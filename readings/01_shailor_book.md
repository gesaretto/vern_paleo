# The Medieval Book
## Barbara Shailor

- Catalogue of an Exhibition at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library (Yale)

- The survey covers the history of the medieval book since the invention of the codex, which progressively replaced the roll. It also covers the transition from papyrus, to parchment, to paper (starting in Spain around the XII c.).

    - It actually covers many such transitions; a notable one is the shift from _ruling with a stylus_ (leaving an impression--or a furrow--on the page, visible on both sides) to _ruling with a crayon_ (which became the norm--everywhere but in Italy--around the __XII__ century).


- The survey (after sections on scribes and writing practices) then starts listing and showcasing different kinds of scripts, seemingly in chronological order.

    1. Roman Square Capitals

    2. Roman Cursive

    3. Latin Uncial (350-800)

        - Luxeuil Minuscule (vii-viii s. -- France)

        - Visigothic (viii-xi s. -- Spain)

    4. __Carolingian Minuscule__ (ix s.-xii s.)

    > __Note__: here word separation and punctuation become standard practices.

        - Late Carolingian Minuscule (x-xii s.)

        > __Note__: this bears similarities with Gothic.

    5. __Gothic__ (xii s.-xv s.)

    > __Note__: Shailor points out that, while England privileged the angular forms of high Gothic, southern Europe (Italy, southern France) carried the round clarity of Carolingian into the new style--giving birth to a fusion called "round Gothic" (or _littera rotunda_).

    6. __Humanistic__ bookhand (xv s.)

- Then the survey focuses on __decoration__ and its functions.

    - Interesting transitions here as well; Shailor claims, for instance, that we start seeing __narrative__ (human and animal) decorative details only in the xii s., especially inside initials (before then it was mostly plant and vine motifs).

    - Borders progressively start to cover the entirety of the page between the xiii and the xiv century.
