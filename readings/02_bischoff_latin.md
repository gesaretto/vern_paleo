### Latin script in antiquity

- Capitalis is "the rival display script to uncial" from the ix s. until the xii s.

- We can see the development of a "Later Roman cursive" between the iii and the iv s.

- __Uncial__ appears around the iv s.; a variant of this script, called _half-uncial_ developed almost simultaneously.

    - The __insular half-uncial__
