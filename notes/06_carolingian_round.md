## Anglo-Saxon Round Minuscule

### Historical Background

- Alfred reacts to the Vikings; that is, the AS kingdoms feel a push back, towards the North.

- There was much exchange between Vikings and Anglo-Saxons, in culture and in religion. Beowulf was probably written with these contacts in mind.

- Danish invasions occur regularly between the 730s and the 870s; only Wessex resists to these invasions.  

- __Asser__ (a Welsh bishop under his rule) wrote a biography of King Alfred; this _Life of Alfred_ was probably influenced by the _History of Charlemagne_, written in the previous century.
    - We have a story of Alfred being fascinated with an _illustrated book_--which, according to the story, he memorized before being able to read.
    - He promoted translation from great Latin books of the period.
    - Generally, under Alfred, people were re-learning how to produce _codices_ (they had been accustomed to only producing _charters_).
    - Alfred dies around 899-901 (right at the cusp of the X century); before then, he makes a deal with the Danes, who accept to remain in the North of Wessex.
    - This period of cultural expansion follows a general decline of learning, so that Alfred is forced to bring scholars from elsewhere (just as Charlemagne had done with Alcuin of York).
    - Again, in the __AS Chronicle__ Alfred imposes a national version of Anglo Saxon (among many dialects available); he decides on _one language_ that everybody ought to learn--a project that of course carries egemonic aims with it.
        - The Hatton MS of the Chronicle comes right out of Alfred's circle.

- _Edward the Elder_ rules for 25 years after Alfred.
    - He founds some important _religious houses_, for instance in __Whicnchester__: "Nunnaminster." This is an important copying center during the XII s.; it carries on the tradition of writing and transcribing Anglo-Saxon works; it preserves its style of decoration; this is probably where the __round minuscule__ develops.

- _Æthelstan_ rules between 924 and 941.
    - Under his influence we see a circulation of __manuscripts and relics__ from Europe; Æthelstan brings to England the MSS that carry the _Carolingian script_. Here we also have frequent contacts with Brittany (this has happened since Celtic times).
    - In this period we have the reformation of several monasteries, which leads to differences in the production of scripts and books.
        - Among the reformed monasteries we have __Glastonbury__ and Abbington.
        - This is also the time when __cathedrals__ shift under the supervision of __monks__; it is a feature of England at the time-- a way to spread the reformed values of Benedict to the laity.
    - We have a reformation of the __coinage__.

- Edgar the Peaceful.
    - Under him we have the establishment of __carolingian minuscule__ for Latin (this process goes hand in hand with the benedectine reform--the __Regularis Concordia__).
    - This is a period of __flowering of arts and culture__; this brings a heightened __production and circulation of books__.
