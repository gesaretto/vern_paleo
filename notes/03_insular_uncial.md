## The "Insular System" of Scripts

### Preliminary remarks

- We can detect how patterns of Christianization produced changes on scripts (affected the transmission of continental features into the insular system, and vice versa).

- Pay attention to how:

    - _Rustic capitals_ differ from _uncials_;
    - _Uncials_ differ from _semi-uncials_;
    - _Semi-uncials_ differ from _cursive-semiuncial_.

        - Keep track of the letters that distinguish these, particularly because in an __insular context__ they can be __mixed up__.

- For what concerns the Latin system of scripts, try and practice imitating:

    1. Rustic capitals;
    2. uncials;
    3. semi-uncials.

- An important distinction--between:

    - _majuscule_ and
    - _minuscule_ scripts.

        - Some people explain this distinction as based on __pen angle__:

            - _majuscule scripts_ are written at a 90 degree angle (uniformly thick strokes);
            - _minuscule scripts_ are written at a 45 degree angle (different strokes, thinner and thicker).

        - Other people (including CB) consider the amount of _sections_ the body of the letter can take:

            - _majuscule scripts_ are two-lines scripts; that is, they are written between __two imaginary lines__ (the body has equal height);
            - _minuscule scripts_ are written on __four imaginary lines__, because of the distinction between short letters and letters that have ascenders and descenders (which require a lower line and a higher line).

### Distinguishing between _uncial_ and _semi-uncial_

- Looking at a _Roman semi-uncial_ of c. 500 we notice that these letters are different (from uncial):

    - the letter __t__ (straight in uncial, curved in semi-uncial);
    - the letter __s__ ("majuscule," two-curve "s" in uncial; tall, straight "s" in semi-uncial);
    - the letter __d__ (round in uncial; minuscule "d," with a straight right ascender in semi-uncial);
    - the letter __a__ (slanted minim and small, v-shaped left side in uncial; shaped like an u, or an o, in semi-uncial--with progressively more open top);
    - the letter _g_, elongated and minuscule, with a straight top-stroke;
        - note that the letter __N__ remains of the three-stroke kind, like in uncial; this is a feature of early semi-uncial, which changes in time;
        - note the presence of __ligatures__:
            - some are less prominent, like an "__e__" written with a single stroke out of the top part of a "t"; others are more pronounced, like an "__nt__" ending where the "t" is just a horizontal stroke on top of the leftmost minim of the "n."  

- The __hierarchy of scripts__ is an invention that appears when multiple scripts are available at once; scribes realize that they can use different scripts (rather than different colors or different sizes) to convey importance and emphasis, or to distinguish between different parts of the page. It's already a convention when these scripts are imported into England.

- In our study of the use of Latin scripts in an insular context, we often refer to the __Codex Amiatinus__ (vii-viii s.) as to one of the most refined examples. It shows a complex hierarchy of scripts; the main one is modeled after "the finest Roman uncial" (Bischoff, 71). The Codex Amiatinus was produced in the monastery of Wearmouth and Jarrow, in Northumbria; it is the earliest extant copy of the entire Vulgate. Its use of uncial derives from the Irish practice (Lindisfarne, then Canterbury).

### Irish idiosyncrasies

- __Plimpton O54__ (RBML) is a remarkable example of Irish MS production; its surface is smooth and "suede-like." Besides scraping and smoothing the parchment, Irish book-makers would rub it with a pumice stone; this makes it impossible for us to distinguish between flesh side and hair side (the follicles have been completely removed). (It makes the page stiffer and heavier, as well.)

    - Since we are able to determine what parchment was produced in Ireland, we can also find examples of MS written on the continent whose parchment was originally prepared there.

- Another feature that characterizes the Irish production of Latin MS is the use of __punctuation__; this is because the Irish were not familiar with Latin, and required an extra aid to distinguish between words and sentences on a page. The Irish were among the first people who systematically wrote Latin as a second language; for this reason, they are among the first ones to use punctuation.

- The __descenders of uncial__ start to go below the line in Irish MS of Latin.

- More peculiar __letter forms__ to note:

    - the letter __a__ has two developments:

        - a __pointed a__, which characterizes _Anglo Saxon_ scripts;
        - a __rounded a__, which characterizes _Carolingian_ (continental) scripts;

    - the letter __p__, which starts to split and open up at the top.

- In Irish writing, scribes start to include "__club__," spatulate __ascenders__ (thicker at the top).

- Generally, the Irish __love to be calligraphic__.

- Irish documents circulate widely in a broader Christian network of book production; that is way many Irish texts (of Irish origin) actually have a continental _provenance_ (they are found on the continent).

- Irish scribes use abbreviations derived from Latin tachygraphy which were not widely used on the continent; one of these is a two-stroke cursive "__autem__" (looks like part of an "m"), very distinctive of Irish production.

- Concerning decoration, a typically Irish (insular) feature is the __diminuendo__: the use of a __large initial__, followed by increasingly smaller capital letters, to produce a pleasant graphic effect.
