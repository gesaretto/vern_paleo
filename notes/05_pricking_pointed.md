## Anglo-Saxon Pointed and Square Minuscule

### Pricking

- Keep in mind that _pricking_ and _layout_ are two different fields; the latter is a complicated and even intellectually fraught field (there's even a whole book on the subject, by [Hammond?]).

#### Plimpton MS 127

- It is a copy of Isidore's _Etymologies_; this is the earliest book produced in Ireland.

- Note the pricking in the inner margin; this is an __insular practice__ from an early time. We find it in this document from __Germany__; this was a monastery founded by Irishmen in Germany.

- Note:

    - the spatulated ascenders (typically Irish);
    - the fact that the scribe _ignores the base line_ (typically Irish; this is made with a _hard point_, it's a fold in the parchment);
    - the strange _mixed_ script (very Irish; it's been called a _degraded Irish script_);
    - the punctuation (three points; Irish feature);
    - the __diminuendo__, an Irish feature;
    - the _strange_ Tironian signs (for example, a "division sign" and a sort of "H" with an extra stroke, for "autem")

#### Pricking techniques

- There are different ways to prick: an awl, a knife, a wheel with awls sticking from it (it's never been found, possibly a legend spread by paleographers), a sheet with awls sticking from it (which you would use to leave an impression on the chair).

- __Note__: many of these books were probably manufactured by women--_nuns_, in particular, would often copy books (be asked to do so). Unfortunately, we very rarely know the identity of a scribe (or a book manufacturer) for sure; we can conjecture that more women were involved in the process than one would initially think.

### AS Pointed Minuscule

#### Codex Aureus

- Really well formed pointed minuscule (this is, of course, the AS annotation that runs at the bottom of the page).

- Note the __descenders__ (pointed) and at the minims (the ends of minims).

- Consider the tall a: it's a big feature of AS minuscule.

#### Alfredian translation of the _Cura Pastoralis_

- Three shapes of "a" alternate in AS scripts:

    - the so-called "teardrop" _a_;
    - the elongated minim _a_;
    - the open a with a closing stroke on top;
        - this gets more and more "squarish"; the closing stroke is, of course, a new addition.

#### Brown Plate 20

- The _diminuendo_ is soon exported into the continent (circulates in the Carolingian period).

- We start seeing __minims__ replace many groups of letters.
