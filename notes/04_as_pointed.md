## Anglo-Saxon Pointed Minuscule

### Historical Notes

- The Christianization of Ireland was peaceful--not done at sword-point; it occurred as sort of dialogue between __Britonic__ (Celtic) people and Latin people.

- A reminder: the four main A-S kingdoms were:
    - Wessex (SW);
    - Mercia (Central W);
    - East Anglia (Central E);
    - Northumbria (N).
        - We can add Kent (SE) as a fifth one.

- Christianization came both from above (that is, from Northern Ireland and the islands off Scotland) and below (Roman).

- The first attempt at Christianizing Ireland was made by Palladius in 430; but he was __banned__ from there (proof that it was a peaceful conversion; it was not imposed).

- The most important conversion is probably that completed by S. Patrick in the Mid V s.; he converted in most of the Irish island. S. Patrick was probably Welsh.

      - In the meanwhile, the Romans have left Britain (410).

      - Therefore, the Anglo-Saxons are well in place in England around the year 600.

- St. Columba in Iona (as well as other Irish centers doing the same) starts exporting  Christianity from Northern Ireland to Northern Britain; they bring their __scripts__ with them. Among these converted, new centers of Christianity in NB we find Lindisfarne.

    - Together with scripts, they exported the Roman __calendar__.

    - This is why we see __Irish hands__ (ductus) and __decoration__ come into the English production.

- The kings of AS Britain start converting __early__; the first one is __Edwin__ in __Northumbria__.

    - Bede has a wonderful story about how and why this happened; Edwin saw a bird fly into the hall--it reminded him of the fleetingness of mortal life, against the mysterious eternity of the afterlife.

        - After Edwin, the monk Aidan founded __Lidisfarne__.

        - St. Cuthbert, a monk who was a contemporary of Aidan, supervised the production of the __Cuthbert Gospels__ in Lindisfarne; it is meaningful because it bears the __oldest surviving binding__ in the Western world.

            - _The Cuthbert Gospels were apparently used for burials; we find annotations that mark the massages relevant to funeral ceremonies._

        - Also in Lindisfarne, we find Wilfrid, influential for the __Lindisfarne Gospels__ (different from the Cuthbert ones); this is lavishly decorated, and characterized by an elegant half-uncial script.

            - Apparently, Lindsfarne is also known for the _earliest surviving bible_ (uncertain).

- In York, Alcuin (brought here by Charlemagne) starts a great library.

- In 793 (a little affter Alcuin's arrival in York), the monastery of Lindisfarne is raided by Vikings; the monks move to __Durham__ (now the best preserved medieval library in an English monastery).

- At this point (end of s. VIII), we start having people from Canterbury (that is, from the South), sent from the pope (the legend said that he cared about the Angles after having seen one in Rome, and called him an "angel").

    - __Theodore of Tarsus__, born in the Far East of the Mediterranean, is sent to Canterbury with a hoard of books; he brings with him an __unchanged uncial script__ (influential on book production after s. VIII).

- In 664 we have the __Synod of Whitby__; it's important because it involves a mediation between the __Irish calendar__ and the __Roman calendar__.

- The complex of Wearmouth Jarrow is founded later; it is another __romanized monastery__.

    - __Bede__ spends his entire time in Jarrow; he probably had a great library at his disposal there; the _Historia Ecclesiastica_ is full of precise references to classical works and history.

    - The Codex Amiatinus is supervised by Ceolfrid; a copy was supposed to be brought to Rome, but Ceolfrid--who was carrying it there--died on his way, in Northern Italy.

    - The general move, concerning the centers of production, seems to be from __North to South__.

- Around __865__, after the beginning of the most serious Danish incursions, Viking armies start invading and remaining in England.

    - The most significant resistance to the Viking incursions is provided by __King Alfred the Great__; he is able to reassert Anglo-Saxon power up to Mercia and East Anglia. He manages a deal (a truce) with the Northern viking kingdoms.

        - At this point, the Danes begin to convert; they learn Anglo-Saxon, they become literate. This might be the origin of _Beowulf_.

    - Alfred is succeeded by Edward the Elder, who is apparently extremely belligerent.

### Plates and Scripts

#### Brown Plate __16__

- We see a fluctuation between the use of the uncial and semi-uncial "N" (with a diagonal middle stroke between two vertical minims), and the minuscule "n" (two minims closed at the top).

    - This transition into the new two-minims minuscule "n" is a __late insular development__ (into the viii s.).

- The __oc__-shaped "A" is apparently typical of hybrid scripts.

#### Roberts Plate __1__ (The St. Petersburg Bede)

- This is a case of pointed/current minuscule (the terminology overlaps).

- Here we see __new letter forms__: the wynn, the thorn, the eth.

#### Roberts Plate __2a__

- Interesting because of the _translation_.

#### Keller AS Plate __1__

- Note the pointed "a," with a very tall second stroke.

- This is a charter; the first hand uses a __minuscule script__; the second hand uses a __hybrid minuscule__ (higher step up in hierarchy); it is heavily __uncialized__ and more set (we note oc-shaped "as", and a prominently uncial "R").

#### Roberts Plate __3__

- It's the Codex Aureus; MS do not get more "Irish" (in style and decoration; in lavishness) than this.

- The second stroke of the long, minuscule "r" (with the first stroke being a long descender) gets closer to the base line in __later developments of the minuscule__.

- We note that ligatures become more frequent and sophisticated.

#### Roberts Plate __6__ (Bodleian Hatton MS 20)

- Dated 890.

- Alfred is resisting the Viking invasions; but he is also worried about the state of Latin. He decides that, to facilitate the use (and the learning) of Latin, he will promote book production in Anglo-Saxon (this is a political move; there were other languages spoken on the island--the most conspicuous one being Welsh).

- This is a conspicuous example of __pointed__ minuscule (look at how __elongated__ the descenders are).

- Also note the fact that somebody added a stroke at the top of the "a," to close it--it looks very square this way (into the square phase).

- Interesting feature of this MS: it seems to have been produced at a time when people forgot how to make books properly (it is poorly put together).
